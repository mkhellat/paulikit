# Installation

Full installation reference. For the common case, the README's
Installation section is enough; this document covers the build
system's requirements, the editable-install sequencing, and the
optional native extensions in detail.

paulikit is built with [meson-python](https://mesonbuild.com/meson-python/)
(the same build backend NumPy and SciPy use), and optionally compiles
several Cython/C(/C++) kernels that accelerate the transform, gather,
coefficient emission, Hermiticity check, Pauli labels, and cache
probe — see [Native extensions](#native-extensions) below.

**Recommended for development:** run `./configure` from this
directory. It creates/reuses a dedicated venv (default
`~/.venvs/paulikit`, deliberately outside the source tree — meson
rejects an absolute in-tree numpy include path if the venv lives
inside the project root), prints an itemized capability/environment
diagnostic report (compiler, Cython, TBB, cache hierarchy, NumPy's
BLAS backend, etc.; run `./configure --help` for the full list), and
generates a `Makefile` with the standard GNU set of
targets (`all`/`build`/`install`/`install-strip`/`installdirs`/
`check`/`test`/`installcheck`/`uninstall`/`docs`/`dist`/`TAGS`/
`clean`/`mostlyclean`/`distclean`/`maintainer-clean`/`report`) that
handle the `--no-build-isolation` editable-install sequencing below
correctly and automatically:

```bash
./configure                 # accepts --prefix/--docdir/--srcdir/VAR=value
                             # and the standard GNU dir-var options too, see --help
make                         # = make all = make build (editable install)
make check                   # run the test suite
```

If you'd rather not use `./configure`, the manual sequence it
automates is:

```bash
pip install numpy meson-python cython ninja
pip install -e . --no-build-isolation
```

`--no-build-isolation` is required for editable installs: without it,
NumPy's include path gets baked in from a throwaway build-isolation
environment that goes stale on later rebuilds (this is NumPy's own
documented practice for meson-python editable installs, not a
paulikit-specific quirk) — and `numpy`/`meson-python`/`cython`/`ninja`
must already be installed in the target environment first, since
`--no-build-isolation` means pip won't fetch them into a throwaway
env for you the way it normally would. A regular, non-editable
`pip install .` does not need any of this.

With test/profiling dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]" --no-build-isolation   # pytest, PennyLane (for fixture regeneration/reference checks), scipy
pip install -e ".[dev]" --no-build-isolation    # the above, plus Cython and ruff
pip install -e ".[docs]" --no-build-isolation   # Sphinx / Furo / MyST stack for `make docs`
pip install -e ".[sparse]" --no-build-isolation # just scipy, for build_hamiltonian(sparse=True) / pad_to_power_of_two(sparse=True)
```

Requires Python >= 3.10. Runtime dependencies are just `numpy` — the
core algorithms have no dependency on PennyLane, Qiskit, or Classiq;
those are only used in the `test`/`dev` extras, for generating and
cross-checking correctness fixtures. `scipy` is likewise optional:
only needed for the `sparse=True` path on `build_hamiltonian`,
`pad_to_power_of_two`, and (as an input type)
`fwht_pauli_coefficients`/`fwht_pauli_terms` -
calling any of those with `sparse=True` (or passing a
`scipy.sparse` operator directly) without `scipy` installed raises a
clear `ImportError` naming the `sparse` extra, rather than silently
falling back to the dense path. Building from source always
requires `meson-python`, `Cython`, and `numpy` (PEP 517/518's
`[build-system] requires` has no conditional mechanism), but both are
pure-Python-installable — no C toolchain is needed just to build the
pure-Python parts of the package.


## Native extensions

Three independent meson feature options gate the compiled modules
(defaults are all `auto`: build if the toolchain is present, otherwise
fall back quietly at import time with a one-time warning when a
fallback path first runs):

| meson option | Modules | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `wht_kernel` | `wht_native` (+ optional `wht_native_v3`), `coeffs_native` (+ optional `coeffs_native_v3`), `gather_native`, `hermitian_check_native` | C compiler + Cython ≥ 3.0 |
| `native` | `pauli_label_native` | C++ + Cython ≥ 3.0 + [oneTBB](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB) |
| `cache_probe` | `cache_probe` | C compiler + Cython ≥ 3.0 |

The `wht_kernel` set carries the transform, gather, coefficient
emission, and Hermiticity check — these are the modules that matter
for throughput and for the threaded drain. `pauli_label_native` only
accelerates label-string generation (the dict-returning APIs).
`cache_probe` feeds `paulikit.algorithms.autotune`'s chunk sizing.

The optional `_v3` twins of the WHT and coefficient kernels are the
same source compiled a second time under `-march=x86-64-v3` when the
build toolchain accepts that flag. The public API picks between a
module and its `_v3` twin at **import** time from a runtime CPU check,
never at build time, so a wheel built on a newer CPU stays correct
(just slower) on an older one.

To force behaviour explicitly:

```bash
# Fail the build if a feature cannot be compiled:
pip install -e . --no-build-isolation \
  --config-settings=setup-args="-Dwht_kernel=enabled" \
  --config-settings=setup-args="-Dnative=enabled" \
  --config-settings=setup-args="-Dcache_probe=enabled"

# Force pure-Python / declared-cache fallbacks:
pip install -e . --no-build-isolation \
  --config-settings=setup-args="-Dwht_kernel=disabled" \
  --config-settings=setup-args="-Dnative=disabled" \
  --config-settings=setup-args="-Dcache_probe=disabled"
```

The compiled extensions are currently optional accelerators, not a
hard requirement — paulikit has no prebuilt-wheel CI yet, so requiring
a C toolchain for every `pip install` would be too heavy a default.
This is a deliberate, temporary trade-off. Migrating to prebuilt
wheels (so the kernels can become a hard requirement, matching the
NumPy/SciPy model) is tracked as a near-term goal.
