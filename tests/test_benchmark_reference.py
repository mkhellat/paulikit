"""Not a correctness test - a documented, reproducible comparison
between paulikit.algorithms.fwht and PennyLane's qml.pauli_decompose
on the *same* real coupled-oscillator Hamiltonians, at matched N.

Skipped by default (marked slow) since N=50/100 take PennyLane
minutes; run explicitly with:

    pytest tests/test_benchmark_reference.py -m slow -s

Requires the `test` extra (PennyLane) to be installed.

Why this exists: an earlier baseline comparison used a synthetic
tridiagonal-band sparse matrix as a stand-in for "the real
Hamiltonian's sparsity pattern," rather than the real
build_hamiltonian() output. That stand-in happened to decompose to
far fewer Pauli terms than the actual coupled-oscillator Hamiltonian
does at the same N, which understated PennyLane's real runtime and
made the eventual comparison look more lopsided in paulikit's favor
than it actually is. This test/script benchmarks both implementations
against the exact same matrix, so the numbers are directly comparable.
