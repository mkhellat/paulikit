"""Original Pauli decomposition via the Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT).

Implements the O(N^2 log N) algorithm (N = 2**n) described in
"Pauli decomposition via the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform"
(https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/adb44d), as an
alternative to an O(4^n)-with-symbolic-overhead brute-force approach.

This is an original implementation: the algorithm's three steps were
independently re-derived and verified against a from-scratch,
definition-level brute-force decomposition (Frobenius inner product
against every tensor-product Pauli string) before writing the fast
version, rather than transcribed from the paper. See
``tests/test_fwht.py`` (package root) for that verification.

See the full documentation site (``docs/``) for a much more detailed
treatment: :doc:`/background` (the physical problem this solves),
:doc:`/theory` (this module's derivation, worked step by step with a
hand-verified example), and :doc:`/non_hermitian` (physical examples
of non-Hermitian operators and a worked complex-coefficient example).

Mathematical basis
-------------------
Using the symplectic (X/Z) representation of an n-qubit Pauli string,
indexed by bitmasks x, z in [0, 2**n):

    P(x, z) = bigotimes_{j=0}^{n-1} i**(x_j & z_j) * X**x_j * Z**z_j

(qubit j corresponds to bit (n-1-j) of x and z, matching the row/column
order produced by a left-to-right ``numpy.kron`` chain).

The matrix element ``<p| X**x Z**z |q>`` equals
``(-1)**popcount(q & z)`` when ``p == q ^ x``, and 0 otherwise. So the
Frobenius inner product coefficient is:

    c(x, z) = (1 / dim) * conj(i**popcount(x & z))
              * sum_q H[q ^ x, q] * (-1)**popcount(q & z)

For fixed x, the inner sum over q, as a function of z, is exactly the
(unnormalized, +-1 butterfly) Walsh-Hadamard Transform of the
"anti-diagonal gather" g_x(q) = H[q ^ x, q]. This is the paper's three
steps: (1) the XOR-index gather/permutation building g_x for every x,
(2) the Walsh-Hadamard Transform applied to each g_x, (3) the
phase-factor multiplication by conj(i**popcount(x & z)) / dim.

Complexity: building all 2**n gathers and running a length-2**n WHT on
each costs O(2**n * n * 2**n) = O(n * 4**n) -- i.e. O(N^2 log N) for
N = 2**n -- versus a naive approach's O(4**n) *symbolic* trace
evaluations, each of which itself costs O(2**n) or worse with symbolic
(e.g. SymPy) overhead. The fast approach also parallelizes trivially
across x (each row's gather + WHT is independent); this module
implements that parallelization (see ``parallel_decompose`` and
``parallel_decompose_arrays`` below).

Hermitian and non-Hermitian operators
---------------------------------------
Nothing in the derivation above requires H to be Hermitian: the Pauli
strings span the full space of 2**n x 2**n complex matrices, so
``fwht_pauli_coefficients`` decomposes *any* complex matrix exactly,
producing complex coefficients in general (real coefficients are the
special case that results from Hermitian input). ``fwht_pauli_terms``
defaults to ``assume_hermitian=True`` for convenience with this
package's primary use case (real-symmetric coupled-oscillator
Hamiltonians) but supports ``assume_hermitian=False`` for arbitrary
operators - relevant for, e.g., non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonians
of open/dissipative systems, PT-symmetric Hamiltonians, Liouvillian
superoperators, or individual non-Hermitian summands of a Hermitian
total.

    full Python lists plus a dedup dict, which at N=150 is >20 GB and
    simply could not run.

    Stops cleanly at the first frame that is incomplete (a crash
    mid-write) or absent from ``valid_indices`` (recorded but never
    marked complete). Because a reader stops at the first such frame,
    a duplicate can never survive to be read, which is what removes
    the need for the old ``last_by_key`` deduplication entirely.
    Corruption that is not a clean truncation - a bad magic in an
    earlier frame - still raises, since that is real damage rather
    than an interrupted append.

    operators" section. Hermitian input (e.g. a real-symmetric
    coupled-oscillator Hamiltonian) yields real coefficients; general
    input yields complex coefficients.

    Args:
        operator: A ``(2**n, 2**n)`` matrix (real or complex).
            Dimension must be an exact power of two - pad with
            ``paulikit.hamiltonian.pad_to_power_of_two`` first if not.
        sparse: If ``False`` (default), returns the full dense
            ``(dim, dim)`` array described below - unchanged behavior,
            kept as the default so existing callers are unaffected. If
            ``True``, returns only the active (nonzero-row) data
            without ever materializing the dense array - see Returns.
            The dense array's O(dim**2) memory/re-scan cost dwarfs L3
            cache well before it dwarfs the operator's own sparsity
            (confirmed via hardware performance counters);
            ``sparse=True`` is the fix for callers that only need the
            nonzero terms, such as ``fwht_pauli_terms``. Both modes
            compute identically up to the final step - this only
            changes what's returned, not the sparsity-aware
            computation itself.
        chunk_size: Only used when ``sparse=True``. If ``None``
            (default), all active rows are gathered and transformed at
            once (one ``(n_active, dim)`` array live in memory - fine
            for moderate N; returns the dense-block form described
            below). If set to a positive integer, active rows are
            processed in blocks of at most ``chunk_size`` rows - the
            tiling technique from MIT 6.172 lecture 1 (block the
            computation to bound working-set size), applied here for
            memory-footprint reduction rather than cache reuse, since
            each row transforms independently (see
            ``_walsh_hadamard_transform_rows``) with no cross-row
            reduction to preserve. Unlike ``chunk_size=None``, this
            mode also thresholds each chunk's output against ``atol``
            immediately and accumulates only the surviving ``(x, z,
            coefficient)`` triples (see Returns) - bounding peak memory
            to ``O(chunk_size * dim + n_final_terms)`` rather than
            ``O(n_active * dim)``, since an earlier ``chunk_size``
            design still allocated one full ``(n_active, dim)``
            accumulator regardless of ``chunk_size`` - that
            accumulator was the actual N=150 ceiling, not the
            per-chunk transient ``chunk_size`` was designed to bound.
        atol: Only used when ``chunk_size`` is set. Coefficients with
            ``abs(coefficient) <= atol`` are dropped per-chunk, before
            accumulation - moved here (rather than staying purely in
            ``fwht_pauli_terms``) because thresholding must happen
            before accumulation for the space-complexity fix above to
            work; the dense-block modes (``chunk_size=None``) are
            unaffected and keep returning unthresholded output.
        checkpoint_path: Only used when ``chunk_size`` is set. If
            given, each completed chunk's surviving triples are
            appended to ``checkpoint_path`` as one binary chunk-framed
            record - a small fixed-width header (magic, format
            version, index dtype, chunk index, term count) followed by
            the raw ``x``/``z``/``coeff`` arrays' bytes, with no
            per-term Python object construction on the write path -
            and a sibling ``<checkpoint_path>.progress.json`` file
            records progress as one 8-byte little-endian ``u64``
            record per completed chunk, appended in order; the next
            chunk to process is one past the highest recorded index.
            If a
            checkpoint already exists at this path when called, chunks
            already recorded there are skipped and replayed frame by
            frame, one original chunk at a time, rather than
            recomputed - resuming a crashed or interrupted run rather
            than restarting from chunk 0. This costs one small file
            append per chunk (negligible next to each chunk's
            O(chunk_size * dim * log dim) transform cost), so it is
            opt-in but effectively free when enabled; ``None``
            (default) does no I/O at all.

    Returns:
        If ``sparse=False``: a complex ``numpy.ndarray`` of shape
        ``(2**n, 2**n)`` where entry ``[x, z]`` is the coefficient of
        the Pauli string ``P(x, z)`` (see module docstring for the

    ``dict`` of terms per chunk instead of building one combined
    ``dict`` for the whole operator.

    Why this exists (the actual problem, not just a memory
    workaround): each chunk of active rows is a fully independent
    sub-problem - there is no cross-chunk combination step anywhere in
    the underlying math (unlike, say, tiled matrix multiply's
    block-sum reduction). ``fwht_pauli_terms`` re-fuses every chunk's
    result into one dict before the caller ever sees it, which is an
    artificial recombination the math does not require, not a
    necessary step - the actual divide-and-conquer strategy for this
    problem is to keep each tile a tile all the way to the caller.
    This matters beyond just fitting in memory: at N=150, the full
    combined result is 91.65M terms (several GiB for the raw data
    alone, more once label strings and a single dict's hash-table
    overhead are added), too large for a dict-returning API to handle
    on modest hardware, regardless of any per-chunk memory bound. A
    caller that only needs to, e.g.,
    write terms to disk, filter them, or fold them into a running sum
    never needs the full combined dict to exist at once.

    Args:
        operator: Same contract as ``fwht_pauli_terms``.
        chunk_size: Required (no default) - unlike
            ``fwht_pauli_terms``, there is no dense/whole-array mode
            here; streaming without chunking is not a meaningful
            combination.
        atol: Same as ``fwht_pauli_terms`` - applied per-chunk inside
            ``fwht_pauli_coefficients``.
        assume_hermitian: Same as ``fwht_pauli_terms``, but checked
            per-chunk rather than for the whole operator at once: a
            ``ValueError`` raised on chunk *k* means chunks
            ``0..k-1`` were already yielded to the caller before the
            error. This is a real behavior difference from
            ``fwht_pauli_terms``, which
            either returns a fully valid dict or raises before
            returning anything; a streaming caller that needs
            all-or-nothing Hermiticity validation should call
            ``fwht_pauli_terms`` (non-streaming) instead.
        checkpoint_path: Same as ``fwht_pauli_terms`` - passed through
            to ``fwht_pauli_coefficients``'s chunked accumulation
            internals for crash/resume. Checkpoints are stored as a
            binary chunk-framed format (one
            self-describing frame per completed chunk - see
            ``_append_checkpoint_frame``/``_iter_checkpoint_frames``),
            not a per-term text log. Note this checkpoints the
            underlying coefficient computation, not this generator's
            own iteration state - resuming a streaming consumer that
            was itself interrupted partway through consuming chunks
            means simply calling this function again with the same
            ``checkpoint_path``; already checkpointed chunks are
            replayed one frame at a time, per original chunk (see
            ``_iter_chunked_coefficients``), so a consumer sees the
            same chunk boundaries a resumed run would have produced
            on a first pass, not one merged replay tile.
        parallel_labels: If ``True``, uses the oneTBB-parallel label
            kernel (``pauli_label_batch_parallel``) per chunk instead
            of the serial kernel. Measured **in isolation** as a real
            ~1.1-1.4x wall-clock win at N=150-representative scale, at
            the cost of a modest cache-locality regression. However,
            re-measured embedded in the real streaming pipeline at
            N=150, this delivers **no measurable wall-clock or
            cache-locality difference either way** - label generation
            is only ~7% of
            total pipeline time, dwarfed by dict construction (~60%),
            so the isolated effect washes out to noise at the
            whole-pipeline level. Left opt-in (default ``False``) since
            it is not harmful, just not a meaningful lever for this
            pipeline's actual performance.

    Yields:
        One ``dict`` per chunk, same value-type contract as
        ``fwht_pauli_terms`` (``float`` values if
        ``assume_hermitian=True``, ``complex`` otherwise). A chunk
        with no surviving terms above ``atol`` yields an empty dict,
        not a skipped chunk - callers that want to skip empty chunks
        should filter for truthiness themselves.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``operator`` is not square or its dimension is
            not a power of two (raised immediately, before the first
            chunk is yielded - this check does not depend on any

    """Auto-picks streaming vs. dense and an auto-tuned ``chunk_size``.
    Returns either a ``dict`` (dense path, same as
    calling ``fwht_pauli_terms`` with no ``chunk_size``) or an
    ``Iterator[dict]`` (streaming path, same as calling
    ``fwht_pauli_terms_iter``) depending on a runtime decision based on
    the operator's size and the machine's currently-available memory.

    **This return type is a runtime decision, not a fixed contract** -
    unlike ``fwht_pauli_terms``/``fwht_pauli_terms_iter``, which always
    return a ``dict``/``Iterator[dict]`` respectively regardless of
    machine state. This is deliberate: making an *existing* function's
    return type depend on runtime memory state would be a hidden-
    nondeterminism hazard (the same call could silently take a
    different code path on a re-run) and would silently change
    ``assume_hermitian``'s validation-contract difference between the
    two paths (all-or-nothing vs. partial-yield-then-error) out from
    under a caller who never asked for that.
    ``auto_decompose``'s name documents this nondeterminism
    explicitly; callers that need a fixed contract
    should call ``fwht_pauli_terms``/``fwht_pauli_terms_iter`` directly
    instead. A typical caller checks the result with
    ``isinstance(result, dict)``.

    The streaming-vs-dense decision is based on a memory budget
    (``paulikit.algorithms.autotune.available_memory_bytes``) that is
    cgroup-aware, not just physical-RAM-aware - correctness-critical on
    a shared HPC node, where a scheduler (Slurm/PBS) commonly caps a
    job below the node's full physical RAM via a cgroup; using
    physical memory alone there could wrongly choose the dense path
    inside a job actually capped well below what dense would need. The
    streaming path's own ``chunk_size`` is likewise auto-tuned
    (``autotune.recommended_chunk_size``) via an empirical cache-
    latency probe rather than a fixed example value.

    The dense-path memory estimate deliberately errs conservative: a
    real ``resource.getrusage`` sweep found the dense path's actual
    peak footprint fits well under the available budget at some sizes
    where this function's own (already 6x-inflated, see
    ``_DENSE_MEMORY_MULTIPLIER``) estimate says to stream instead.
    This means ``auto_decompose`` will sometimes choose streaming where
    dense would in fact have fit and been somewhat faster; this
    imprecision is intentional, not a bug - for a safety-critical
    memory decision, occasionally streaming when dense would have
    worked is a far better failure mode than occasionally choosing
    dense and running the process out of memory. A caller that knows
    its own memory headroom precisely and wants the dense path's
    typically-faster performance can call ``fwht_pauli_terms`` directly
    instead of going through this estimate.

    Args:
        operator: Same contract as ``fwht_pauli_terms``.
        atol: Same as ``fwht_pauli_terms``.
        assume_hermitian: Same as ``fwht_pauli_terms`` (dense path) /
            ``fwht_pauli_terms_iter`` (streaming path) - see those
            functions' own docstrings for the validation-contract
            difference between them, which still applies here
            depending on which path is chosen.
        checkpoint_path: Same as ``fwht_pauli_terms``/
            ``fwht_pauli_terms_iter`` - only meaningful if the
            streaming path is chosen.

    Returns:
        A ``dict`` if the dense path was chosen, or an
        ``Iterator[dict]`` if the streaming path was chosen - check
        with ``isinstance(result, dict)``.

    ``autotune.recommended_chunk_size(dim)`` only targets cache

    even in the single-process path (memory there is
    bounded by ``auto_decompose``'s separate streaming-vs-dense
    decision, not by ``chunk_size`` itself). Under parallelism, up to
    ``n_workers`` chunks' ``O(chunk_size * dim)`` working sets are live
    SIMULTANEOUSLY rather than one at a time - reusing the
    single-process cache-driven value unchanged here would multiply
    real peak memory by roughly ``n_workers`` with no corresponding
    check. Returns the smaller of the cache-driven value and the
    largest chunk_size whose working set fits within one worker's
    share of the memory budget

    setup arrays every worker holds resident regardless of
    ``chunk_size`` (see ``_per_worker_resident_bytes``) - from that
    per-worker budget, so the remaining chunk_size bound reflects what

    Distributes chunks across a ``ProcessPoolExecutor``
    instead of processing them one at a time in this process; each
    chunk is a fully independent sub-problem (no cross-chunk
    combination step in the underlying math - see
    ``_iter_chunked_coefficients``'s own docstring), which is exactly
    what makes this a real, not just nominal, parallelization.

    A new top-level function rather than a parameter added to
    ``fwht_pauli_terms_iter`` - deliberately, matching
    ``auto_decompose``'s own precedent: changing an
    *existing* function's iteration-order/resource-lifetime contract
    based on a new parameter is a bigger compatibility hazard than
    adding a new function with its own, clearly different contract
    (results here are NOT guaranteed to arrive in chunk order - see
    Yields below).

    **The two auto-tuning quantities this depends on
    (``recommended_chunk_size``, ``available_memory_bytes``) were
    measured/derived on a single lone process - see
    Args below for how this function adapts each for real multi-worker
    use rather than reusing them unchanged.**

    Args:
        operator: Same contract as ``fwht_pauli_terms``.
        chunk_size: If ``None`` (default), the smaller of (a)
            ``autotune.recommended_chunk_size(dim)`` (the
            cache-locality formula, derived for a single lone
            process's cache - concurrent workers competing for one
            shared LLC/memory bandwidth may have a different real
            optimum, not yet re-measured under concurrent load) and
            (b) the largest
            chunk_size whose ``O(chunk_size * dim)`` working set fits
            within one worker's share of the memory budget
            (``autotune.per_worker_memory_budget_bytes(n_workers)``),
            AFTER first subtracting each worker's fixed resident
            footprint - the ``operator`` copy and setup arrays every
            worker holds for its whole lifetime, not just its current
            chunk (see ``_per_worker_resident_bytes``) - this second
            bound is necessary because up to ``n_workers`` chunks are
            live simultaneously here, unlike the single-process path,
            where only one chunk's working set is ever live at a time.
            Pass an explicit value to override either bound.
        n_workers: If ``None`` (default), uses
            ``_detect_available_worker_count()`` -
            ``len(os.sched_getaffinity(0))`` where available (Linux),
            not ``os.cpu_count()``, so a cgroup/cpuset-restricted HPC
            job is not over-subscribed. Pass an explicit value to
            override (e.g. to leave headroom for other work on a
            shared node).
        atol: Same as ``fwht_pauli_terms``.
        assume_hermitian: Same as ``fwht_pauli_terms_iter`` - checked
            per-chunk, same all-or-nothing-per-chunk (not
            all-or-nothing-per-operator) contract; see that function's
            own docstring for the difference from ``fwht_pauli_terms``.
        checkpoint_path: If given, checkpoints are written as the same
            binary chunk-framed format ``fwht_pauli_terms``/
            ``fwht_pauli_terms_iter`` use - one shared writer
            (``_append_checkpoint_frame``) and one shared reader
            (``_iter_checkpoint_frames``) on both paths, so a
            checkpoint written by either is resumable by the other
            (see ``docs/tutorial.md``). Both paths use the same
            append-only progress marker: one 8-byte little-endian
            ``u64`` record per completed chunk, appended to a sibling
            ``<checkpoint_path>.progress.json``/
            ``.parallel_progress.json`` file
            (``_append_progress_record``), and recovered by reading
            whole records into a set and discarding any torn trailing
            record (``_read_completed_indices``). What differs is only
            how each path turns that set into a resume point: the
            sequential path derives its single ``next_chunk`` index as
            ``max(recovered) + 1``, valid because chunks finish
            strictly in order, while this function uses the recovered
            set directly, because parallel workers finish out of
            order. The two progress markers use distinct file suffixes
            so they never collide; resume here re-submits every chunk
            index not already in that set, regardless of position.

    Yields:
        One ``dict`` per completed chunk, same value-type contract as
        ``fwht_pauli_terms_iter``. **Order is not guaranteed to match
        chunk order** - chunks are yielded as workers complete them,
        which depends on runtime scheduling, not input position. A
        caller that needs chunk-order output should sort/buffer
        itself; most callers (writing to disk, accumulating into an
        unordered structure, filtering) do not care about order.

    Raises:
        ValueError: Same conditions as ``fwht_pauli_terms_iter``,
            raised immediately for the shape/power-of-two check (before
            any worker starts); the ``assume_hermitian`` violation
            case is instead raised (as a chunk-processing exception,
            re-raised in the main process) once the offending chunk's
            worker task completes - unlike the sequential generator,
            this does not guarantee every chunk submitted *before* the
            offending one has already been yielded to the caller by
            the time it raises, since chunks do not complete in
            submission order.

    Identical machinery to ``parallel_decompose`` (same chunking, same
    auto-tuning, same bounded submission, same CPU pinning, same
    checkpoint format) with one difference: it yields each chunk's raw
    arrays instead of building a ``dict[str, complex]`` from them.

    That difference is the whole point. Building ~91.6M Python ``str``
    objects and dict entries at N=150 is ~82% of ``parallel_decompose``'s
    total runtime, all of it in the single parent process, which caps
    its speedup at ~1.21x no matter how many cores are available
    (measured: best-ever 1.284x, and 8 workers gives 1.100x). Removing
    that work from the drain loop was measured to restore real
    multi-core scaling - 2.191x, statistically indistinguishable from a
    control doing no drain-side work at all.

    Use ``terms_from_arrays`` to render any chunk (or a filtered subset
    of one) to the usual label -> coefficient dict.

    Yields:
        ``(x, z, coeff)`` per completed chunk: two integer arrays of

        order** - same contract as ``parallel_decompose``. A chunk with
        no surviving terms yields three empty arrays rather than being

    # (n_workers=8) at N=150, confirming this, not the chunk_size
    # working set, was the dominant memory cost. Keeping at most
    # roughly one in-flight task per worker (plus a small pipelining
    # margin) bounds the backlog to O(n_workers), matching the

    # sibling collisions (two workers on the same physical core at
    # once) at every n_workers value tested, not just when n_workers
    # exceeds the physical core count. pin_cpus is one representative
    # logical CPU per physical core (None if unavailable - non-Linux,
    # or the physical-core probe itself failed); next_pin_index is a
    # cross-process shared counter each worker atomically increments
    # on startup to claim a distinct entry (ProcessPoolExecutor's
    # initializer gives every worker identical initargs, with no
    # built-in per-worker ordinal of its own).

        # Threads work here for one specific reason: both compiled
        # kernels release the GIL, so `_parallel_worker_chunk`'s real
        # cost runs genuinely concurrently. Measured per chunk, the
        # GIL-held part (the zeroed block, the value slice, the
        # scatter) is 13.0us against 374.6us inside the kernels - a
        # serial fraction of f = 0.0336.
        #
        # Measured scaling (perf cycles, which unlike wall clock on
        # this machine are frequency-invariant): 1.87x on 2 threads
        # and 3.44x on 4, against Amdahl ceilings of 1.93x and 3.63x
        # for that f. Threading costs only 7% and 16% extra cycles
        # respectively.
        #
        # Why it is worth having: with the transform compiled, a chunk
        # costs ~0.5ms while a ProcessPoolExecutor round trip costs
        # ~1.33ms, so the process path became a net loss at these
        # sizes (0.94x at N=100, 0.81x at N=150, at 3-5x the CPU).
        # Threads pay no pickling at all - the arrays never leave this
        # address space.
        #
        # Everything else is deliberately unchanged: same chunking,
        # same atol, same checkpoint format, same yield contract, same
        # bounded in-flight window. Only the drain differs.

    Uses the compiled ``pauli_label_native`` extension when available

    alternative bindings during development); falls back to the
    pure-Python ``pauli_label`` loop otherwise, since paulikit must
    stay pip-installable without a C++ toolchain. The fallback is
    NOT silent: paulikit's whole purpose is
    fast Pauli decomposition, so running the slow path unknowingly
    would defeat the point of the package - a warning fires once per
    process the first time the fallback is actually used.

            instead of the serial ``pauli_label_batch`` kernel. Real

            (~1.1-1.4x measured at 40M terms), but
            no measurable benefit once embedded in the real streaming
            pipeline at N=150 - dict construction there dominates at
            ~60% of total time, dwarfing labeling's ~7% share. Left
            opt-in rather than the default, since it is not a
            meaningful lever for real-pipeline performance. Ignored
            (falls back to serial, or
            the pure-Python loop) if the native extension is
            unavailable - the ``parallel`` and native-availability
